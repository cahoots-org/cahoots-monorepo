<p>Whether you're a product manager scoping a new feature, a founder sketching out an MVP, or a developer tackling a complex system—you've faced the same challenge: turning a high-level idea into actionable work. A simple-sounding feature like "Add user authentication" can explode into dozens of subtasks (OAuth flows, session management, password policies, UI components, API endpoints, database schemas, etc).</p>

<p><strong>Cahoots automates this cognitive load.</strong></p>

<h2>What It Does</h2>

<p>Cahoots takes high-level project descriptions and breaks them down into atomic units of work—ready to import directly into your existing tools.</p>

<p>Give it "Build an online marketplace for handmade goods" and it will:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Analyze the domain</strong> — identifying core concepts like sellers, buyers, listings, orders, and payments</li>
  <li><strong>Organize into logical chapters</strong> — grouping related work like "Seller Onboarding", "Product Catalog", "Checkout Flow"</li>
  <li><strong>Decompose to atomic tasks</strong> — producing specific, implementable work items with clear acceptance criteria</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain context across the hierarchy</strong> — so each task knows how it fits into the bigger picture</li>
</ol>

<h2>Export Where You Work</h2>

<p>Once your project is decomposed, export directly to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>JIRA</strong> — as issues with proper hierarchy</li>
  <li><strong>Trello</strong> — as cards on your boards</li>
  <li><strong>JSON</strong> — for custom integrations</li>
  <li><strong>Other options coming soon</strong></li>
</ul>
