# Task Decomposition: The Hidden Bottleneck in Software Development
*A 10-15 minute talk for programmers*

---

## Opening Hook (1 minute)

"When someone says 'Build an e-commerce platform' or 'Create a SaaS application,' the real challenge isn't the coding - it's figuring out what to build. What are all the components? How do they interconnect? What's the logical sequence of implementation?

This cognitive process - project decomposition - is how we transform a product vision into hundreds or thousands of concrete, implementable tasks."

---

## What I Built (2 minutes)

"I built a tool called Cahoots that uses an LLM to decompose projects into tasks. You give it something like 'Build a task management app' and it breaks it down into subtasks, recursively, until it reaches implementable pieces.

The interesting part isn't the AI - it's what happens when you apply it systematically to project decomposition. Let me show you."

---

## What I Found (2 minutes)

"The AI doesn't actually understand project decomposition. It's just pattern-matching from its training data.

But most projects aren't that unique. An e-commerce platform needs products, cart, checkout, user accounts - the same components every e-commerce platform needs. The AI has seen thousands of these patterns and can recall them instantly.

It's not insight. It's memory at scale."

## Introducing Cahoots (2 minutes)

[Open Cahoots on screen]

"This is Cahoots - an AI-powered task decomposition system. Let me show you a real example."

[Type in: "Build a task management application like Trello"]

"Watch what happens..."

[Show the decomposition]

"Cahoots decomposes the entire project:
- User management system (authentication, profiles, teams)
- Board architecture (lists, cards, drag-and-drop)
- Real-time collaboration (WebSockets, presence indicators)
- Notification system (email, in-app, webhooks)
- Search and filtering infrastructure
- Permission and access control layers
- API design for third-party integrations

Each of these major components breaks down further into dozens of atomic tasks. The entire project might decompose into 200+ implementable work items."

---

## The Technical Approach (3 minutes)

[Show tree visualization]

"Cahoots uses a multi-pass approach:

**1. Complexity Analysis**
First, it analyzes whether a task is 'atomic' - can one developer implement this in one focused work session? If not, it needs decomposition.

**2. Hierarchical Breakdown**
Tasks are broken down recursively. 'Build e-commerce site' becomes 'Product catalog', 'Shopping cart', 'Payment processing'. Each of those breaks down further until we reach atomic tasks.

**3. Context Preservation**
Unlike traditional task management tools, each subtask maintains context from its parent. The 'Add to cart' button knows it's part of the shopping cart system, which is part of the e-commerce site.

**4. Implementation Hints**
For atomic tasks, it provides implementation guidance - not code, but architectural decisions, libraries to consider, common pitfalls.

The system achieves this with:
- A unified analysis that combines complexity scoring, atomicity checking, and approach suggestions in a single LLM call
- Caching of common decomposition patterns
- Maximum depth limits to prevent over-decomposition"

## Live Demonstration (3 minutes)

"Let's see it work with a real-world project from the audience. What application or platform are you building or planning to build?"

[Take suggestion from audience]

[Enter it into Cahoots]

"Notice how it's decomposing this in real-time. The system is:
1. Identifying major components
2. Breaking each component into implementable tasks
3. Stopping at the right level of granularity

Let's look at one of these atomic tasks..."

[Click on an atomic task]

"See the implementation hints? This is the context that usually lives only in a senior developer's head - now it's captured and transferable."

## The Practical Impact (2 minutes)

"Let's talk about real impact, not theoretical benefits:

**For Individual Developers:**
- No more staring at a blank screen wondering where to start
- Better estimates because you see ALL the work upfront
- Learn decomposition patterns from the AI's consistency

**For Teams:**
- Consistent decomposition regardless of who does it
- New team members can decompose tasks like veterans
- Reduced back-and-forth between PMs and developers

**For Organizations:**
- More accurate project timelines
- Better resource allocation
- Knowledge capture that doesn't walk out the door

One user told me: 'It's like having a senior architect available 24/7 to help break down requirements.'"

---

## The Architecture Evolution (1 minute)

"A quick technical note about the implementation:

We started with a complex microservices architecture - separate services for complexity analysis, decomposition, caching, etc. Classic over-engineering.

The refactored monolith version:
- Reduced from 7 services to 1
- Cut LLM API calls by 50-60% through unified analysis
- Simplified from 8 Docker containers to 2
- Maintained the same decomposition quality

Lesson learned: Start simple. You can always add complexity later."

---

## Why This Matters (1 minute)

"Task decomposition is the bridge between 'what we want to build' and 'how we build it.' It's been a human bottleneck for decades.

By automating the mechanical parts of decomposition - the pattern matching, the checklist running, the subdivision logic - we free humans to focus on the creative and strategic decisions.

This isn't about replacing project managers or senior developers. It's about giving every developer the decomposition abilities of a senior architect."

---

## Closing (1 minute)

"Cahoots is open source and available on GitHub. You can run it locally with Docker in about 2 minutes.

But more importantly, this is just one example of how AI can augment our development process. Not by writing code for us, but by helping with the cognitive overhead that surrounds coding.

The future isn't AI replacing programmers - it's AI eliminating the friction between idea and implementation.

Thank you. Questions?"

## Q&A Prep

**Expected questions and factual answers:**

1. **"How does it actually work?"**
   - Uses LLM (configurable - OpenAI, Groq, etc.) with specialized prompting
   - Recursive decomposition until tasks are atomic
   - Caching layer for common patterns
   - Maximum depth of 5 levels to prevent over-decomposition

2. **"What defines an 'atomic' task?"**
   - Single responsibility
   - Implementable in one focused session
   - Clear success criteria
   - No hidden subtasks

3. **"How much does it cost?"**
   - Depends on LLM provider
   - Caching reduces API calls significantly
   - Can run with local models for zero cost

4. **"What about proprietary/sensitive projects?"**
   - Can be self-hosted entirely on-premise
   - Works with local LLMs
   - No data leaves your infrastructure

5. **"How is this different from just asking ChatGPT?"**
   - Structured decomposition process
   - Maintains hierarchy and context
   - Provides consistent output format
   - Implementation hints for atomic tasks
   - Caching and optimization

## Demo Backup Plans

If live demo fails:
1. Have screenshots of decomposition examples ready
2. Show the tree visualization with a pre-loaded task
3. Focus on the problem discussion rather than the tool

---

## Key Facts to Remember

**The Problem:**
- Task decomposition happens before every feature/sprint
- Traditionally done by PMs and senior devs
- Inconsistent across teams and individuals
- Knowledge doesn't transfer well

**The Solution:**
- AI applies decomposition patterns consistently
- Recursive breakdown to atomic tasks
- Maintains context through hierarchy
- Provides implementation hints

**The Implementation:**
- Started as 7 microservices, refactored to monolith
- 50-60% reduction in LLM calls through optimization
- 2 Docker containers (app + Redis)
- Open source, self-hostable

## Speaking Notes

- Keep focus on the PROBLEM (task decomposition bottleneck) not just the solution
- Use concrete examples (authentication, e-commerce, etc.)
- Emphasize this augments human expertise, doesn't replace it
- Be honest about limitations - it's a tool, not magic
- Invite audience participation for demo
