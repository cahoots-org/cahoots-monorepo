# Combat Performance Tracking Protocol

## Equipment Performance Tracking
Each piece of equipment must be tracked across battles with:
1. Success rate in actual usage
2. Types of problems it helped solve
3. Situations where it failed
4. Synergies with other equipment

Example:
- Pattern Recognition Lens
  - Success: Identified correct issue 7/10 times
  - Problem Types: Async patterns, memory leaks, cache consistency
  - Failure Cases: Complex concurrent operations
  - Synergies: Works well with Test Coverage Shield

## Pattern Effectiveness Tracking
Each pattern's real-world effectiveness must be measured:
1. Success rate in fixing similar issues
2. Implementation complexity
3. Test coverage impact
4. Maintenance burden

Example:
- Async Lock Pattern
  - Success: Fixed race conditions 9/10 times
  - Complexity: Medium (requires careful error handling)
  - Coverage Impact: +15% in async tests
  - Maintenance: Low (self-contained)

## Battle Performance Metrics
Track for each battle:
1. Initial approach effectiveness
2. Number of attempts needed
3. Types of damage taken
4. Recovery strategies that worked

Example:
```json
{
  "battle_performance": {
    "initial_strategy_success_rate": 0.6,
    "attempts_to_victory": 3,
    "damage_sources": [
      "async_race_conditions",
      "cache_inconsistency"
    ],
    "successful_recoveries": [
      "lock_pattern_application",
      "enhanced_error_handling"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Equipment Enhancement Protocol
1. After each battle, analyze equipment performance
2. Document specific scenarios where equipment succeeded/failed
3. Track improvement patterns over time
4. Identify gaps in current arsenal

## Pattern Evolution Protocol
1. Record pattern mutations that emerged in battle
2. Document unexpected pattern interactions
3. Track pattern effectiveness across different contexts
4. Maintain history of pattern refinements 

## Battle Damage Protocol

### Damage Tracking Requirements
1. MUST track all damage:
   - Damage dealt to monsters
   - Damage taken by the system
   - Collateral damage to codebase
   - HP loss from failed strategies

2. DAMAGE CATEGORIES:
   - CRITICAL (-50 HP): System-wide vulnerability
   - SEVERE (-40 HP): Component failure
   - MAJOR (-25 HP): Service degradation
   - MINOR (-10 HP): Isolated issue

3. VICTORY POINTS:
   - CRITICAL (+50 VP): Monster head defeated
   - MAJOR (+25 VP): Vulnerability patched
   - MODERATE (+15 VP): Pattern implemented
   - MINOR (+10 VP): Test coverage improved
