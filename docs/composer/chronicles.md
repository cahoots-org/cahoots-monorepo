## ⚔️ Battle Records

### Integration Wraith (Level 8) - ONGOING
**Champion**: Lady Validator (Level 2 Test Coverage Paladin)
**Equipment**: Pattern Recognition Lens, Debugging Sword
**Critical Patterns**: 
- Redis PubSub Synchronous Pattern
- Message Processing Pattern
- Error Resilience Pattern

**Battle Chronicle**:
The Integration Wraith revealed its true power through the Redis PubSub Synchronous Pattern. What appeared as a simple async/await error was in fact a fundamental misunderstanding of Redis's pubsub operations. The Wraith exploited this confusion, causing message processing failures and test instability.

**Lessons Learned**:
1. Redis pubsub operations (subscribe, unsubscribe, publish) are synchronous by nature
2. Attempting to await these methods leads to subtle failures
3. Clear documentation and proper testing of sync/async boundaries is critical
4. Pattern Recognition Lens proved invaluable in identifying the true nature of the issue

**Status**: Phase 1 - Event System Resilience (In Progress)
- [x] Identified Redis PubSub Synchronous Pattern
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Document sync/async boundaries
