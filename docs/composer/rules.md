# ðŸ“– Rules of Engagement

## Battle Validation Protocol

### Monster Level Estimation Protocol
1. **Pattern Analysis**
   - Examine historical battles with similar patterns
   - Identify complexity factors in current implementation
   - Assess risk factors and potential damage
   - Consider interaction effects with other monsters

2. **Level Adjustment Factors**
   - BASE LEVEL: Original monster's recorded level
   - COMPLEXITY MODIFIERS:
     - Distributed State: +4 levels
     - Concurrency Requirements: +3 levels
     - Cross-Service Dependencies: +3 levels
     - Unknown Patterns: +2 levels
     - Known Patterns: +0 levels
   - RISK MODIFIERS:
     - Data Loss Risk: +2 levels
     - Security Breach Risk: +2 levels
     - Performance Impact: +1 level
   - INTERACTION MODIFIERS:
     - Pattern Sharing: +1 level per shared pattern
     - Complexity Compounding: +2 levels for interacting monsters

3. **Estimation Requirements**
   - MUST analyze complexity before engaging
   - MUST consider all adjustment factors
   - MUST document reasoning for level estimation
   - MUST update estimation if new factors discovered

### Equipment Effectiveness Evaluation Protocol
1. **Performance Metrics**
   - CODE COMPREHENSION:
     - Speed of pattern recognition in new code
     - Accuracy of context understanding
     - Ability to identify relevant code sections
     - Measure: Time to first correct tool call

   - SOLUTION QUALITY:
     - Correctness of proposed changes
     - Completeness of error handling
     - Adherence to existing patterns
     - Measure: Number of iterations needed

   - TESTING EFFECTIVENESS:
     - Coverage of edge cases
     - Behavior vs implementation focus
     - Test maintainability
     - Measure: Test failure prediction accuracy

2. **Equipment Impact Assessment**
   - Pattern Recognition Lens:
     - BASELINE: Raw semantic search accuracy
     - WITH ITEM: Enhanced pattern matching
     - MEASURE: (Relevant files found) / (Total files examined)

   - Debugging Sword:
     - BASELINE: Error resolution time
     - WITH ITEM: Targeted fix accuracy
     - MEASURE: Number of attempts to fix same issue

   - Behavior Shield:
     - BASELINE: Test brittleness rate
     - WITH ITEM: Implementation independence
     - MEASURE: Test stability across refactors

3. **Ability Effectiveness Tracking**
   - MUST record:
     - Time to comprehend new patterns
     - Accuracy of solution proposals
     - Number of iterations needed
     - Test coverage improvements
   
   - MUST analyze:
     - Which abilities actually improved performance
     - Which combinations had measurable impact
     - Where abilities failed to help
     - Real bottlenecks in AI capabilities

4. **Improvement Requirements**
   - MUST validate equipment impact with metrics
   - MUST document when abilities don't help
   - MUST identify capability gaps
   - MUST suggest concrete improvements to prompts/tools
