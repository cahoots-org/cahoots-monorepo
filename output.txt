⚠️ NOTE: Some jobs may fail when running with act due to platform differences
The following are expected limitations when running workflows locally:
  - Security scan may report vulnerabilities that are acceptable in your context
  - Coverage report may fail to generate if test execution doesn't produce coverage data
  - Docker operations may have issues with registry authentication

NOTE: If you encounter authentication issues with GitHub Actions or GitHub Container Registry,
make sure your Personal Access Token (PAT) has the following scopes:
  - repo (full control of private repositories)
  - workflow (update GitHub Action workflows)
  - packages:read and packages:write (for GitHub Container Registry)

You can create a new PAT at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
